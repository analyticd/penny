<h1>Why Penny</h1>

<p>With alternatives available
like <a href="http://ledger-cli.org">Ledger</a>
and <a href="http://hledger.org">hledger</a>, this page explains why I
wrote Penny rather than continue using one of these excellent
programs.</p>

<h2>At first, there was Money</h2>

<p>I first tracked my expenditures on computer using Microsoft Money
  under Windows. This created some problems when I switched to
  Linux. For awhile I dual booted just to run Money. I tried Wine but
  it was finicky. For a little while I switched to GnuCash but found
  it wanting.</p>

<h2>Then there was Ledger</h2>

<p>For several years I then used Ledger. At first Ledger seemed like a
  cockamamie idea but I became quite accustomed to it and even liked
  it. As I used Ledger I started writing my own scripts to help me
  with my workflow. For example, I found entering bank transactions to
  be quite tedious, so I wrote little scripts with zsh, awk, and the
  like in order to parse CSV files downloaded from my banks. I wrote
  several automated checks of my data to ensure, for instance, that I
  didn't use any accounts I didn't intend for (this was before Ledger
  3.0, which had a feature to help with this sort of thing.) I also
  made sure certain periodic transactions were present so that I could
  use the output from Ledger to do some short-term forecasts.</p>

<p>Eventually I figured it would have been nice to manipulate this
  data in a structured way, rather than doing it all through text
  processing facilities. My scripts had a lot of nasty hacks that are
  necessary when you are processing plain text rather than working
  with data structures generated by a real parser. Ledger did have
  some sort of Python facility, but because Python does practically no
  static type checking, I find that writing Python offers few
  practical benefits over writing an awk or shell script. So I hobbled
  along with my scripts.</p>

<h2>Then there was hledger</h2>

<p>Then I learned of Haskell, a cutting-edge functional programming
  language. I realized that Haskell could help me write my scripts to
  manage my money: it has a robust static typechecker, so using it
  would actually afford advantages over the shell or awk (to me,
  dynamically typed languages do not offer enough advantages over the
  shell or awk to justify using them for tasks such as this.) Over a
  few years I learned enough Haskell to be dangerous in it, which
  isn't saying much--I am still a Haskell beginner.</p>

<p>So I looked at hledger, which was promising because it could parse
  my ledger files as they were. I did however have various concerns
  about hledger which caused me to limit my use of it. hledger is
  however great at many things, so please continue to use it if it
  works for you.</p>

<p>So I figured I could write my own program which would meet my needs
  perfectly. So here we are.</p>

<h2>How is Penny different?</h2>

<p>My first objective when writing Penny was to build the principles
  of double-entry accounting into the Penny library in a type-safe
  way. This catches most errors at compile time. I also wanted to
  build a library I can use to build custom checks of my data. You
  probably will not notice these objectives if you only use Penny
  from the command line though.</p>

<p>As an end user, Penny brings you a few things that Ledger and
  hledger don't have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Robust filtering</b>. Penny has a rich filtering system that
  allows you to specify with precision which postings you want to see
  in a report. You do this by building an expression on the command
  line.</li>

  <li><b>Automatically adjusting reports.</b> With Ledger I rarely
  changed the reports because I could never remember how to use the
  formatting strings. Penny allows you to simply specify which fields
  you want to see in the report, and it shows them. The report's width
  adjusts automatically to fill your screen. Color is also used well
  (make sure your TERM environment variable is set to something that
  supports 256 colors, as this makes the colors even better.</li>

  <li><b>Persnickety.</b> Ledger will let you enter unbalanced
  transactions, even if they are infinitesimally unbalanced. Penny
  does not allow this.</li>

  <li><b>Automation</b>. Because I wrote Penny with an eye toward
  extensibility and automation, there are some interesting tools to
  help you parse bank transactions automatically. Right now this only
  works with a couple of banks though. But if you are a programmer you
  might be able to add support for your bank with not too much trouble
  if you can write a parser.</li>

</ul>

<p>Penny also suffers from many disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>No community.</b> I use this thing; I have no idea if anyone
  else does. On the other hand, Ledger and hledger both have robust
  user communities and active contributors on a mailing list.</li>

  <li><b>Fewer bells and whistles.</b> Ledger has things like
  interoperability with GnuPlot, XML output, and more. hledger has
  hledger-web. Penny has nothing like these things. Some of these
  things might come later if I find them useful.</li>

  <li><b>Written in Haskell.</b> Haskell makes my life as a programmer
  much, much easier than using something like C++, the language of
  Ledger. However, if you have no interest in programming, Haskell
  makes your life much harder because you have to get a huge compiler
  and use a different build process (not the usual "./configure &&
  make" sort of thing) just to compile it. Being written in C++,
  Ledger is much easier to compile and install and, furthermore, many
  Linux distributors ship pre-compiled binaries.
