<h2>PENNY IS DOUBLE-ENTRY ACCOUNTING
<a name="PENNY IS DOUBLE-ENTRY ACCOUNTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Penny is a
double-entry accounting system. Other accounting systems use
double-entry principles--indeed, they are double-entry
accounting systems--but they do not use traditional
double-entry accounting terms such as <i>debit</i> and
<i>credit</i>. Or, they might use these terms, but not as
they are used in a traditional accounting sense. Unlike
other systems, Penny does not try to hide the details of
double-entry accounting from you. Therefore, you will need
to have basic knowledge of double-entry accounting to use
Penny.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ask yourself
this question: what is a debit? If you said &quot;it&rsquo;s
what happens when my bank charges me money,&quot; read
&quot;Learning about double-entry accounting&quot; below. If
you said &quot;left&quot;, then you&rsquo;re probably ready
to use Penny.</p>

<h2>THE penny PROGRAM
<a name="THE penny PROGRAM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>penny</b> program is Penny&rsquo;s most basic tool. It
gives you reports on what you have recorded in your
<i>ledger</i>, which is simply a text file (or multiple
files) containing your financial transactions. <b>penny</b>
will never modify the data in your ledger; you maintain it
yourself by hand (or by using some of the other programs in
the <b>penny</b> suite, such as <b>penny-fit</b>, which will
modify this data for you under some circumsances.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examine the
<i>starter.pny</i> file, located in the <i>examples</i>
directory of the <i>penny-bin</i> package. It shows the
basics of how to write a Penny ledger file. This man page
will use this file for examples. Please follow along by
typing some of the commands yourself and experiment on your
own.</p>

<h2>HOW penny WORKS
<a name="HOW penny WORKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, some
terminology. Your ledger file contains <i>transactions</i>.
Each transaction consists of at least two <b>postings</b>.
All the postings in a transaction must <i>balance</i>; that
is, the sum of the debits for each commodity must equal the
sum of the credits for that commodity. <b>penny</b> first
reads in all your transactions. All the transactions must be
balanced; if they are not, <b>penny</b> quits with an error
message. Then <b>penny</b> splits the transactions into
postings. After that, <b>penny</b> deals only with the
postings, and not with the transactions that they were a
part of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>penny</b>
then will discard some of the postings and keep others,
depending on the <i>filter specification</i> that you give.
You can also sort the postings; by default they are left in
the order that they were in in the file. Then a
<i>report</i> that you specify is shown. The reports have
additional options that you may specify.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is all
more clear with some examples, so let&rsquo;s go!</p>

<h2>SEEING THE POSTINGS IN AN ACCOUNT
<a name="SEEING THE POSTINGS IN AN ACCOUNT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s say
you want to see the postings in your checking account.</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --account Assets:Checking postings starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">does what you
would expect. If you want to limit the postings to those
before or after a certain date, try one of these:</p>
<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking --and -d &rsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; 2012-12-06 postings starter.pny

penny -a Assets:Checking --and -d &rsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; 2012=12-06 --and \
  -d &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; 2012-12-11 postings starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As these
examples show, you can use <i>-a</i> instead of
<i>--account</i>, and <i>-d</i> instead of <i>--date</i>.
Also, options such as <i>-a</i> and <i>-d</i> are called
<i>operands</i>. If you use more than one operand, you must
join them together using <i>operators</i>. The operators
available to you are <i>--not</i> ,<i>--and</i> , and
<i>--or</i>, in that order of precedence. Here is a more
complicated example that uses the various operators and
operands:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking --and --open --payee &rsquo;Whole Foods&rsquo; \
  --or --payee Comcast --close --and --date &rsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; 2012-12-01 --and \
  --date &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; 2012-01-01 pos starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
also shows that you can abbreviate the name of the report;
that is, instead of <i>postings</i>, you can say <i>pos</i>.
You can use the shortest unambiguous abbreviation, so you
could even simply say <i>p</i> as there is no other report
that starts with a <i>p</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the far
right side of each <i>postings</i> report is a running
balance, like in a checkbook register. You may have noticed
that in the examples above the running total reflects only
the postings you saw in the report. Sometimes that is what
you want. Other times you might want to see the total
running balance, even as it is affected by the postings not
shown in the report. To do this, include the filtering
options <b>after</b> the word <i>postings</i> rather than
before. Filtering options that are included before the word
<i>postings</i> affect which postings are part of the
report. Only postings that are part of the report affect the
running balance. Filtering options <b>after</b> the word
<i>postings</i> affect which postings are <b>shown</b> in
the report. Postings that are part of the report but are not
shown still affect the running balance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --sort date -a Assets:Checking pos -d &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; 2012-12-10 \
  starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
introduces a new option, <i>--sort</i>. You specify the
field name on which you want to sort your postings. To sort
them in ascending order, use all lower case letters when
specifying the name of the field. To sort in descending
order, capitalize the first letter. By default, <b>penny</b>
does not sort your postings; it leaves them in the same
order they were in in your ledger file. If you want to see
the running balance of a report, it&rsquo;s important to
make sure the postings are sorted in chronologial order,
either because you told <b>penny</b> to sort them or because
you always keep your postings in chronological order in your
ledger file (I don&rsquo;t.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here we also
see that you can use the <i>-d</i> option in place of
<i>--date</i>.</p>

<h2>SEEING THE BALANCE OF AN ACCOUNT
<a name="SEEING THE BALANCE OF AN ACCOUNT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To see the
balance of your checking account, you could run</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking pos --tail 1 starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and look at the
running balance shown. This command included all the
postings in your checking account in the postings report,
but it only showed the last posting. (You could have used
the UNIX <b>tail</b> program, but that will not always work
well because sometimes a single posting will take up more
than one line on your screen.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
do it is with</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking balance starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which shows the
accounts hierarchically. The <i>balance</i> report is your
friend if you want to see the balance of many accounts at
once.</p>

<h2>INCOME AND EXPENSES
<a name="INCOME AND EXPENSES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How does your
income compare to your expenses for a certain month?
Try:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --open --account-level 0 Income --or --account-level 0 Expenses \
  --close --and -d &rsquo;&gt;=&rsquo; 2012-12-01 --and -d &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; 2013-01-01 \
  balance starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>--account-level</i> operand takes two arguments. The
first one is the number of the sub-account you wish to
match. For instance, the account <i>Expenses:Food</i> has
two sub-accounts: the first, <i>Expenses</i>, is numbered 0,
and the second, <i>Food</i>, is numbered 1. The second
argument to <i>--account-level</i> is the pattern you wish
to use. All matching accounts will be part of your
<i>balance</i> report. The result of this command shows your
total expenses and total income, and the difference between
the two is shown on the top <i>Total</i> line. (You
don&rsquo;t have to use the <i>--account-level</i> operand,
but it is more precise in this instance. Even more precise
would have been to specify <i>--exact</i> at the beginning
of the command line. Without <i>--exact</i>, a pattern
matches if the pattern you specify is found anywhere within
the target text.)</p>

<h2>BALANCING YOUR CHECKBOOK
<a name="BALANCING YOUR CHECKBOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or, that fun
task also known as &quot;reconciling your account.&quot;
First you want to make sure that the reconciled balance of
your checking account is the same as what the bank says it
was:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking --and --flag R bal starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compare this
total against the opening balance shown on your bank
statment. If they match, good. If not, figure out why and
fix it before proceeding. Then, find each posting shown on
your bank statement in your ledger. Add a <i>C</i> flag to
each posting. After you have found all the bank&rsquo;s
postings in your ledger, run this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking --and --open --flag R --or --flag C --close \
  bal starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The balance
shown should match what is on your bank statement. If not,
make sure you have matched up all the bank&rsquo;s postings
with a posting in your file, and make sure the bank&rsquo;s
amount matches your amount. You can easily see which
postings you have just marked as cleared with:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets:Checking --and --flag C pos stater.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the
balances match up, use your text editor or
<b>penny-reconcile</b>(1) to change the <i>C</i> flags to
<i>R</i> flags.</p>

<h2>WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR NET WORTH?
<a name="WHAT&rsquo;S YOUR NET WORTH?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Try</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny -a Assets --or -a Liabilities balance starter.pny</pre>


<h2>COLORS
<a name="COLORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Output from
<b>penny</b> is easier to read when it&rsquo;s colorful.
<b>penny</b> can use up to 256 colors on your terminal. Just
make sure that your <i>TERM</i> environment variable is set
to a terminal that supports 256 colors. I use
<b>xterm</b>(1), which supports 256 colors, but by default
<b>xterm</b> sets the <i>TERM</i> environment variable to
<i>xterm</i>, which only supports 8 colors. To make
<b>xterm</b> set the <i>TERM</i> environment variable to one
that supports 256 colors, I have the following text in my
<i>~/.Xresources</i> file:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">XTerm*termName: xterm-256color</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After
running</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and launching a
new <b>xterm</b>, the new setting should take effect.
It&rsquo;s likely your operating system is already set up to
automatically merge your <i>~/.Xresources</i> file when you
launch an X session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t like colors, use <i>--scheme plain</i>. By
default, <b>penny</b> does not use colors if its standard
output is not a terminal, though you can override this with
<i>--color-to-file=yes</i>. This can be useful if you are
sending output to a pager such as <b>less</b>(1) and you
want to see colors (with <b>less</b>, you will want to use
the <i>-R</i> option.)</p>
