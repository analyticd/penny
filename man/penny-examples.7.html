<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page
contains more examples of the use of <b>penny</b>(1). At
first you will want to read <b>penny-basics</b>(1) as there
are also many useful examples there.</p>

<h2>SHOWING DIFFERENT FIELDS
<a name="SHOWING DIFFERENT FIELDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each posting
has many characteristics, called <b>fields</b>. For example,
a posting has an account, and perhaps a payee and a flag.
Only some fields are shown in the <b>postings</b> report by
default; <b>penny</b>(1) tells you which ones these are, as
well as the additional fields you can show. To show
additional fields, use the --show option. For instance,
showing the line numbers of a posting can be handy if you
want to track the postings down in your ledger:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --account assets:checking postings \
  --show lineNum starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This adds the
line number to each posting. As you can see if you try it
out, the option does not remove any fields. If you want to
start from a clean slate, try the <i>--hide-all</i>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The width of
the report adjusts automatically to accomodate the fields
you want, while fitting them to the width of your screen.
Most fields are simply as wide as they need to be to show
their information; however, the <i>payee</i> and
<i>account</i> fields will wrap to multiple lines or squeeze
themselves smaller by eliminating letters (respectively) in
order to help the report fit in the width of your
screen.</p>

<h2>FITERING BASED ON SIBLINGS
<a name="FITERING BASED ON SIBLINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each
transaction has at least two postings. The postings in a
single transaction are called <i>siblings</i>. When
<i>penny</i> first runs, it splits each transaction into
postings. Then it generally deals with each posting
independently. However, <i>penny</i> &quot;remembers&quot;
which siblings each posting has. You can then use a
posting&rsquo;s siblings as criteria when you are building a
filter expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
you want to see all the activity in your checking account.
First you try this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --account assets:checking postings starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This tells you
each time your checking account is debited or
credited--which is quite useful. But maybe you want to know
what expenses you are paying for out of your checking
account. The report above is not too useful for that as the
account is always the same: <i>Assets:Checking</i>. What you
want to see is the sibling postings each time there is
activity in your checking account. Try this:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --s-account assets:checking postings starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This works by
selecting each posting that has a sibling posting with the
account <i>Assets:Checking</i>. All postings are included,
even those that are deposits, like those from
<i>Income:Salary</i>. If you only want to see sibling
postings that are also in an Expenses account:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --s-account assets:checking \
  --and --account expenses postings starter.pny</pre>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can see each posting that has a sibling posting that is
in the Assets:Checking account and where the posting itself
is a debit:</p>

<pre style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">penny --s-account assets:checking \
  --and --debit postings starter.pny</pre>
