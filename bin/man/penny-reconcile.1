.TH penny-reconcile 1
.
.SH NAME
penny-reconcile - mark cleared postings as reconciled
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B penny-reconcile
[options]
FILE...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Finds all postings in the input ledger files whose flag is exactly one
letter: the letter
.IR C .
Changes those flags to the letter
.I R
and prints the resulting ledger to standard output.
.
.P
This is useful
when reconciling a financial institution account: you may first mark
postings in your ledger that match a posting on your bank statement
with a
.I C
flag.
.
Because only postings from the current statement will be marked with a
.I C
flag, it is easier to use
.BR penny (1)
to list only the postings that you have just cleared.
.
Then, after
ensuring that the statement is properly reconciled,
.B penny-reconcile
will automatically mark all the posts reconciled.
.
.P
If no
.IR FILE ", or " FILE " is " - ,
read standard input.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.IR "--output FILENAME", " -o FILENAME"
.
send output to
.I FILENAME
instead of standard output.
.
You can use multiple
.I --output
options; to explicitly print to standard output, use
.IR "--output -" .
.
.SH VERSUS sed(1) OR YOUR TEXT EDITOR
You could do this with
.BR sed (1)
or your text editor.
.
Unlike those programs,
.B penny-reconcile
knows the structure of a ledger file.
.
So
.B penny-reconcile
will not, for example, change the text
.IR [C] " to " [R]
where the
.I [C]
appears within a comment, while a naive
.BR sed (1)
script would do so.
.
This would happen only rarely though, so you might
be just fine using a query-replace function in your text editor.
.
.P
Also,
.B penny-reconcile
will tidy up your ledger file--that is, it might rearrange or delete
the non-significant whitespace within a transaction and posting, similar to
.BR penny-reprint (1).
This might be good or bad.
.BR sed (1)
or your text editor, on the other hand, will not do this.
.
.SH EXIT STATUS
0 if everything went fine; some other value if something went wrong
(e.g. a ledger file could not be parsed.)
