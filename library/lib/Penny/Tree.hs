-- | Tree to parse files from disk.
--
-- The Tree hierarchy contains types that correspond to productions in
-- a BNF grammar.  The grammar is for the Penny ledger file format.
-- The start symbol is in "Penny.Tree.File"; also,
-- "Penny.Tree.Package" pairs a "Penny.Tree.File" with a
-- "Penny.Core.Clxn" to represent the name of the file, and
-- "Penny.Tree.Packages" holds multiple Packages.
--
-- Parsing the BNF grammar is only the first step in loading a file;
-- the BNF grammar alone does not capture all the aspects of file
-- validity.  Many of the modules have a function named @toCore@ or
-- similar to change types in this hierarchy to those in the
-- "Penny.Core" hierarchy.  In the case of "Penny.Tree.Lewis", this
-- function is named 'Penny.Tree.Lewis.toAnna'.
--
-- Modules in this hierarchy also contain parsers to parse the BNF
-- grammar as well as the types representing the grammar itself.
-- Typically the parsers are named @parser@.
