= PENNY(1)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME

penny - print reports on Penny postings

== SYNOPSIS

*penny* ['GLOBAL_OPTIONS'] 'REPORT_NAME' ['REPORT_OPTIONS'] 'FILE..'

== DESCRIPTION

The penny(1) command reads one or more 'FILE' specified.  If there is
no 'FILE', or 'FILE' is '-', `penny` reads standard input.  Each
transaction in the given 'FILE' is split into several _clatch_, with
one _clatch_ per posting.  The _clatch_ contains the posting itself,
along with all the siblings of the given posting and related
transaction information.

Then, the list of all _clatch_ is filtered using criteria you specify
in the 'GLOBAL_OPTIONS', which yields a list of _slice_.  This allows
you to remove postings you are not interested in seeing.

The ordering of the options is important; that is, `penny -i -a
Checking` does not have the same meaning as `penny -a Checking -i`.

== GLOBAL OPTIONS

=== Filtering options

These options control the filtering of the list of _clatch_ into the
list of _slice_.


Futher actions on the _slice_ may occur depending on which 'REPORT'
you use.  Reports are as follows.
