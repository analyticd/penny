.SH PENNY IS DOUBLE-ENTRY ACCOUNTING

Penny is a double-entry accounting system. Other accounting systems use double-entry principles--indeed, they are double-entry accounting systems--but they do not use traditional double-entry accounting terms such as
.I debit
and
.IR credit .
Or, they might use these terms, but not as they are used in a
traditional accounting sense. Unlike other systems, Penny does not try
to hide the details of double-entry accounting from you. Therefore,
you will need to have basic knowledge of double-entry accounting to
use Penny.

Ask yourself this question: what is a debit? If you said "it's what
happens when my bank charges me money," then read on. If you said
"left", then you're probably ready to use Penny.
