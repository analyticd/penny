# A Penny file consists of a list of transactions and prices.  First we
# will consider transactions. A transaction consists of a "top line",
# which has information common to the whole transaction, and a number of
# "postings".
# 
# The top line is optional.  If you have one, it consists of a list of
# rose trees:
# 
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree
# 
# Each node of the rose tree can be one of the following things:
# 
# * a date, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD
# 
# * a time, formatted as HH:MM or HH:MM:SS
# 
# * a time zone, formatted as +MMMM or -MMMM
# 
# * a number, which can be any non-negative integer, or
# 
# * arbitrary text.  Arbitrary text can be quoted with double quotation
#   marks, or it can be unquoted if it contains no special characters.
# 
# Each node has an optional list of child rose trees.
# 
# This is a flexible framework that allows you to use parent nodes as
# labels and child nodes as corresponding values.
# 
# A top line is followed by a number of postings.  A posting consists of
# an optional amount, followed by an optional list of rose trees.
# 
# This is a comment
