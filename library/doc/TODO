* Change parsers to allow for backslash-escaped characters. Most
  likely this will involve creating a new Parsec Stream instance and
  changing the token type. A Token could have two constructors: one
  for unquoted characters, and one for quoted characters. The terminal
  predicates will then take this token type as a parameter.

* Allow RPN expressions as a compile-time option

* Improve error messages for parse errors on expressions. Probably
  this will involve tagging each operator and operand with location
  information that could be used to look up the original location of
  the operator or operand in the command line.
