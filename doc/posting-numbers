Transaction metadata level
--------------------------
global-transaction - compares transaction to all transactions read in from all files.
global-posting - compares posting to all postings read in from all files.
file-transaction - compares transaction to all transactions in the same file.
file-posting - compares posting to all postings read in the same file.


Box level
---------
filtered - compares posting to other filtered postings.
sorted - compares posting to other sorted postings.
visible - compares posting to other visible postings.

Filtering options allow filtering only on transaction
metadata. Visibility options (on the postings report) allow filtering
on transaction metadata, on filtered serials, and on sorted serials.

Command line options consist of the name of the serial, followed by a
separate word indicating ascending or descending order. For example:
"--global-transaction-ascending" or "--global-transaction-descending".

Field names for the postings report consist of the name of the serial
followed by "-asc" or "-dsc" for ascending or descending order.

Zinc (using some functions in Liberty) first takes transactions and
splits them into PostingChild instances. Zinc then filters the
postings using the expression that was parsed from the command
line. Filtering uses only the serials that exist on the transaction
metadata level. Zinc assigns serials to the filtered PostingChild
instances by placing them in a Box with the Filtered serial as the Box
metadata. Next, the Box list is sorted. Then, Zinc assigns serials to
the sorted Box instances by adding a Sorted serial.

Cabin reports receive a list of Box instances parameterized on a
(Filtered, Sorted) tuple. The Posts report performs additional
filtering to determine which postings will be visible. These are then
assigned a Visible serial. The report is printed from the list of Box
(Filtered, Sorted, Visible) instances.
