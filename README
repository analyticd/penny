Welcome to Penny, double-entry accounting.

Versions that contain at least one odd number are development
versions. They are not posted to Hackage. I try to keep the master
branch in compilable shape. However, development versions may not pass
all tests, and in particular they may have out of date or incomplete
documentation.

Releases consist of code of reasonable quality. All of the groups in
their release numbers are even.
