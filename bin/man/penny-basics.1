.SH THE penny PROGRAM

The
.B penny
program is Penny's most basic tool. It gives you reports on what you
have recorded in your
.IR ledger ,
which is simply a text file (or multiple files) containing your
financial transactions.
.B penny
will never modify the data in your ledger; you maintain it yourself by hand (or by using some of the other programs in the
.B penny
suite, such as
.BR penny-fit ,
which will modify this data for you under some circumsances.)

Examine the
.I starter.pny
file, located in the
.I examples
directory of the
.I penny-bin
package. It shows the basics of how to write a Penny ledger file. This
man page will use this file for examples. Please follow along by
typing some of the commands yourself and experiment on your own.

.SH HOW penny WORKS
First, some terminology. Your ledger file contains
.IR transactions .
Each transaction consists of at least two
.BR postings .
All the postings in a transaction must
.IR balance ;
that is, the sum of the debits for each commodity must equal the sum
of the credits for that commodity.
.B penny
first reads in all your transactions. All the transactions must be balanced; if they are not,
.B penny
quits with an error message. Then
.B penny
splits the transactions into postings. After that,
.B penny
deals only with the postings, and not with the transactions that they were a part of.

.B penny
then will discard some of the postings and keep others, depending on the
.I filter specification
that you give. You can also sort the postings; by default they are left in the order that they were in in the file. Then a
.I report
that you specify is shown. The reports have additional options that you may specify.

This is all more clear with some examples, so let's go!

.SH SEEING THE POSTINGS IN AN ACCOUNT

Let's say you want to see the postings in your checking account.
