.TH penny-custom 7

.SH NAME
penny-custom - creating a custom Penny program

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR penny (1)
does not have a configuration file. Instead, it is easy to compile your own
.B penny
binary that has the settings you want. The advantage of this
configuration-file-free approach is that it is easier for me to write
and means that I don't have to cook up some sort of configuration file
format. The disadvantage is that you will need to have the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler (GHC) installed.

Compiling your own
.B penny
program can be useful if you find yourself always using some settings,
and you wish you could set them by default. (Sometimes it may be easy
to do this using shell aliases, functions, or scripts; other times,
this might not be so easy.) Also, there are some settings that can
only be changed by compiling your own
.B penny
binary.

These instructions will assume you have the
.B cabal
program installed and that you compiled
.B penny
from source (currently nobody distributes precompiled
.B penny
binaries, so this is a fairly safe assumption.)

All you need to do is download the
.B penny-bin
package, or find out where the
.B penny-bin
package archive is on your system. Unpack the
.B penny-bin
archive, and then edit the
.I penny.hs
file. This file is commented so editing it should be fairly simple
even if you know little or no Haskell.

Then, from the directory that has your
.I penny-main.hs
file, run
.I cabal install
and you should be all set, if you have already set up the
.B cabal
program to install programs to a location that is in your
path. Alternatively, run
.I ghc --make penny.hs
and then you will have a
.B penny
binary in the current directory and you can do what you want with it.
