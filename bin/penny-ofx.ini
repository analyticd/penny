# File in which to store database information for this account. You
# must use a different file for each account. Therefore, be careful if
# you cut and paste when you create new accounts in this file, as you
# must change the filename here.
file = "/home/massysett/ledger/bigbank.bin"

# Postings from this account appear under this account in your ledger
# file(s).
pennyAcct = "Liabilities:Current:Bigbank"

# When penny-fit finds a financial institution posting and it
# does not have a matching posting in your ledger, it must create
# a new transaction with two postings. One posting will be in the
# pennyAcct specified above and the other posting will be in this
# account.
defaultAcct = "Expenses:Unclassified"

# All postings will be in this currency
currency = "$"

# The next two options control digit grouping when penny-ofx reprints
# your ledger. groupLeft and groupRight control whether digits are
# grouped to the left and to the right of the radix point,
# respectively. Available choices are:
#
# none - do not group any digits
#
# large - group only if the number to be grouped is greater than 9,999
# (if grouping to the left of the decimal point) or if there are more
# than 4 decimal places (if grouping to the right of the decimal
# point.)
#
# all - group whenever there are at least four digits to be grouped.
groupLeft = "all"
groupRight = "none"

# When recording transactions in the database, penny-ofx examines the
# sign of the amount (positive or negative) to determine whether the
# posting is an increase or a decrease. This determination is always
# recorded in the database accordingly. This option allows you to also
# record an indication that this sign should be reversed. This would
# only come in handy if your financial institution suddenly reversed
# how it reports its transactions; otherwise, you can just rely on the
# "increaseIs" option.
#
# So, unless you a very good reason to change this option, leave it on
# False.
flipSign = False

# Postings from your financial institution are specified in terms of
# increases or decreases. Postings in your ledger are specified in
# terms of debits or credits. The translator specifies how to convert
# a posting from your financial institution to a posting in the
# pennyAcct in your ledger.
increaseIs = Credit

# When penny-fit creates new postings it must put the commodity
# either to the left of the quantity or to the right of the
# quantity. Accordingly your choices here are CommodityOnLeft or
# CommodityOnRight.
commodityOn = Left

# When penny-fit creates new postings it must decide whether to
# put a space between the commodity and the quantity. Accordingly
# your choices here are SpaceBetween or NoSpaceBetween.
