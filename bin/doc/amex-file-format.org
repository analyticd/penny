Amex CSV file format

Current as of December 2, 2012

This documents the Amex CSV that can be downloaded from the Amex
website. Obtain this by using the "Download" link that is available
when viewing account transactions. Be sure to select the checkbox for
"additional transaction details" or the like, as this format contains
the unique Amex ID numbers.

Newlines are with linefeeds only (UNIX style, not Windows style.)
Although newlines separate records, they also appear within some of
the fields, so you cannot split the file into records using newlines
alone (which makes it difficult to use line-oriented tools like awk.)

Here are the fields, in order. The fields are separated by commas. The
list starts at 1 (org-mode does not seem to like starting lists at 0.)

Many fields are unknown. These have always appeared blank in the data
I have.

1. Date. This is given as MM/DD/YYYY followed by a three-digit day of
   the week, such as "Wed".

2. Unknown

3. Description. This is the payee name (often truncated) followed by
   the city and state. This contains many spaces (presumably so it
   would line up in a table?) Appears wrapped in double quotes.

4. Unknown

5. Unknown

6. Unknown

7. Unknown

8. Amount. Charges appear simply with the amount; payments and credits
   appear with a prepended minus sign. This field is not wrapped in
   double quotes.

9. Unknown

10. Category. Appears to categorize the merchant (e.g. "Hardware
    Store") but the exact format is not immediately apparent;
    sometimes a number appears with the description, sometimes there
    are just numbers. This field is wrapped in double quotes.

11. Doing Business As. This seems to be the best place to pull the
    payee information from, as the Description field (number 3) mixes
    this up with other information. Double-quoted.

12. Address. Contains a street address with a city and state. Looks
    something like Street Address (newline) City (newline) State
    2-digit. Note the embedded newlines. Double-quoted.

13. Postcode. Postal code, then newline, then country. Note the
    embedded newline. Double-quoted.

14. Amex ID. A long integer. Appears within both double quotes and
    single quotes, e.g. "'320123300342679128'".

15. Unknown

16. Unknown
