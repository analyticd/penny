To convert these man pages to HTML, use

groff -mandoc -Thtml FILENAME

This will create some extra graphics files as well. It's probably
easiest to run this from the destination directory rather than the
source directory so the extra files get dumped in the right place.

groff seems to do a better job of this than man2html, even though
groff is far from perfect. So don't bother trying man2html
again. Probably the only way to improve the output on HTML is to use
something line Asciidoc.

To convert to PDF, use

groff -mandoc -t -Tps FILENAME

which handles tables much better. The disadvantage is, well, it's
PDF. The output goes to standard output.  Then, use ps2pdf to convert
the PS to PDF.  To make ps2pdf read standard input, you must use the -
option; then specify the output file.
