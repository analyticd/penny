<h1>Penny - extensible double-entry accounting</h1>

<p>Penny is inspired by, but incompatible
with, <a href="http://ledger-cli.org/">Ledger</a> by John Wiegley. It
  is a double-entry accounting system which reads your accounting data
  from plain-text files that you maintain. Tools allow you to query
  your data from the command line.</p>

<p>Penny should work on any recent UNIX system.</p>
