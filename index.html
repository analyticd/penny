<h1>Penny - extensible double-entry accounting</h1>

<p>Penny is inspired by, but incompatible
with, <a href="http://ledger-cli.org/">Ledger</a> by John Wiegley. It
  is a double-entry accounting system which reads your accounting data
  from plain-text files that you maintain. Tools allow you to query
  your data from the command line.</p>

<p>Penny should work on any recent UNIX system.</p>

<h2>Why Penny</h2>

<p><a href="why-penny.html">Why I wrote this thing</a> and how it
compares to Ledger and to <a href="http://hledger.org">hledger</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installing Penny is hard, sorry! It is written
  in <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>, a cutting-edge
  functional language. This means that you need
  the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a> Haskell
  compiler. That alone will cost you at least 700 MB of disk space
  (though in this age of gigabyte disks, maybe this isn't such a big
  deal.)</p>

<p>Making things worse, I use the latest GHC and the latest Haskell
  packages rather than those in the 
  <a href="http://www.haskell.org/platform">Haskell Platform</a>. That
  means you'll need to install a newer release of GHC than the one
  that is in the Haskell platform.</p>

<p>Here are the steps you can take to install Penny:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the latest version
  of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc">GHC</a> (currently Penny is
  developed using version 7.6.2).</li>

  <li>Install <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall">cabal
  install</a>, a command line tool that makes it easy to install new
  Haskell packages. Strictly speaking you don't <i>need</i> it, but it
  makes life much easier.</li>

  <li>Run <code>cabal install penny-bin</code> as root.</li>

  <li><code>cabal install</code> does not install the documentation;
  to do that, find out where <code>cabal install</code> downloaded
  the <code>penny-bin</code> tarball (usually this will be
  in <code>$HOME/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/penny-bin/$PENNY_VERSION</code>.)</li>

  <li>Unpack the tarball somewhere, change to the directory that gets
  unpacked, and as root run <code>./install-docs</code>. That will put
  the manpages in the correct places.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Most of Penny's documents are written in roff for consumption by
  your UNIX man page reader; they are also here for your
  convenience. I
  use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbl">tbl</a> in the man
  pages, but apparently those tables are not showing up in the HTML
  version, sorry. They are just showing up as empty images. They
  render fine in my <b>man</b> reader.</p>

  Penny</p>

<p><a href="man/penny-fit.1.html">penny-fit.1</a> - can help you
  automatically import transactions from your bank, though it will
  require rudimentary Haskell knowledge and the only out-of-the-box
  support is for American Express and Bank of America.</p>

  you when reconciling your bank accounts</p>

<h2>Hackage pages</h2>

<p>Hackage is a repository of Haskell packages, sort of like CPAN if
  you are familiar with that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/penny-lib">penny-lib</a>
  - the Penny library, most of the functionality is in here.</li>

  <li><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/penny-bin">penny-bin</a>
  - the binaries package. This page also has a Penny sales pitch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Surely there are no bugs in this software! But if you find some, or
  if you just have some nifty idea and you want me to look at it, the
  best way to do it is by using git
  and <a href="https://github.com/massysett/penny">Github</a>. You can
  also <a href="mailto:omari@smileystation.com">email me</a>. I can't
  lie, it takes me forever to respond to emails, so I apologize in
  advance. The best thing about Github is that you can fork the code
  and go off on your merry way; Penny's BSD style license is no
  impediment to that and believe me, if you do that I won't be
  offended.</p>

<p>Start by rummaging around in
  the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/penny-lib">Haddock
  documentation for penny-lib</a>, though it is not as good as it
  should be. Start at the top and work your way down through each
  level of the tree.</p>

<h2>Using Penny? Let me know...</h2>

<p>I develop this software because I find it useful; it's the classic
  "itch-scratching" kind of thing. So if nobody uses it, I really
  won't mind. Buf if you do use it, and you want to let me know - even
  if it's just to say "gnucash, hledger, and Mint are all better, what
  are you thinking, but there are some interesting ideas buried in
  here" - then feel free to let me know
  on <a href="https://github.com/massysett/penny">Github</a> or
  by <a href="mailto:omari@smileystation.com">email</a>.</p>
