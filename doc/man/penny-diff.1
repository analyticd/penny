.TH penny-diff 1

.SH NAME
penny-diff - show differences between two Penny files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B penny-diff
[-12] FILE1 FILE2

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B penny-diff
shows the Penny items present in FILE1 that are not present in FILE2,
as well as the items present in FILE2 that are not present in
FILE1. An item is a transaction, a price point, or a single-line
comment. Blank lines are ignored. Differences in the order of items are
ignored. Because each single-line comment is its own item, no
difference will be detected if the single-line comments appear in a
different order in the two files, as long as all the same lines are
present.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -1
Show only the items present in FILE1 that are not present in FILE2.

.TP
.B -2
Show only the items present in FILE2 that are not present in FILE1.

.SH VERSUS diff(1)
You could do this with
.BR diff (1).
The biggest difference is that
.B penny-diff
understands and parses the ledger file, while
.B diff
does not. Experiment with the two programs to see which works better in your situation (and take note of options in
.B diff
such as
.IR -b " and " -w ,
which can ignore some whitespace changes.)

.SH EXIT STATUS
0 if there are no differences between FILE1 and FILE2; 1 if there are
differences; 2 if there was some problem (such as a file that could
not be parsed.)
